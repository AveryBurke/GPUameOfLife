# WebGPU Game of Life

I've added user interaction and configurability to this [codelabs tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0) to teach myself WebGPU.

## Dependencies

You will need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. You also need [Chrome 10.13 or later](https://www.google.com/chrome/) in order to use WebGPU

## Usage

Start the app server with `yarn start`, then go to http://localhost:1234/ in your browser. The grid is randomly seeded on each refresh. You can change the state of a cell by clicking on it, or your can change the state of a number of cells by holding down your mouse button and moving the mouse accross the grid. More functionality to come.
